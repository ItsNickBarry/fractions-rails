When players log into the Minecraft server, check for changes to username and update database accordingly.  If a player's new name matches another player's name, deactivate other player's account.

This could be done through the Rails application, but a secret API key would be needed.  Otherwise, access database directly

An in-game command is needed to reclaim stolen accounts.
